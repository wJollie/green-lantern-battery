When a Green Lantern ring with an RFID tag is brought near the lantern, the system powers up:  LEDs fade in with a breathing glow effect to simulate charging energy.  The DFPlayer Mini module triggers a sound effect stored on a microSD card.  The light and sound stay active as long as the ring remains nearby.
